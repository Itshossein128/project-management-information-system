# Specification Quality Checklist: Contracts & IPC Gap Closure

**Purpose**: Validate completeness and quality of the feature specification before planning

**Created**: 2026-10-09

**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation leakage into specification

## Notes

- Spec is a **gap closure** over existing contracts/IPC — intentionally references “current vs FR-CON” for planning.
- Ready for `/speckit-plan`.
